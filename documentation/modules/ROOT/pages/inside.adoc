= Inside a container

You can easily run commands inside a running container, as you do in any other host.

To perform it in our running container, just execute this:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker exec -it my-container /bin/bash
----

Your terminal prompt should by now like this:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[jboss@24543489a4b1 ~]$
----

What you can do is directly related to what you installed inside your container, but a `curl` works in general:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl localhost:8080/hello
----

To go back to your previous terminal, just run:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
exit
----
